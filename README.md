## Installation

Clone the repository on your local machine.
Open a new tab in your browser window. Drag and drop the eyes.js file onto the
new tab. The project will load an appear in your browser. You will see
two eyes appear and start following your mouse movements.

## Usage

### Usage:

Simulate an eye which follos you at any cursor position.
What are eyes without a nose, what is a nose without a mouth and what is a mouth
without a face? These are all fantastic questions which we hope to solve in the
future iterations of the Eye Exercise. By the time we are done it just may need
to be renamed to the Full Body Exercise. Tracking mouse movements to eventually
make a full body move across the screen is the goal here.

### Expected outcomes:

See an eye movement which follos your mouse cursor position; follow simulation.
What are eyes without a nose, what is a nose without a mouth and what is a mouth
without a face? These are all fantastic questions which we hope to solve in the
future iterations of the Eye Exercise. By the time we are done it just may need
